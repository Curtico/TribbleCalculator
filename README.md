>they appear infrequently on-screen, they have become a popular feature of the Star Trek universe, featuring
>in their own eponymous official card game, and even lending their name to a family of proteins which are
>associated with the biology of the fruit fly.

This program calculates how many tribbles there will be after leaving x tribbles alone for y hours.
